            <h1 class="margin text-center">JavaScript Project</h1>
            <p>This project was created with the coding language Javascript. The purpose of this project was to direct the user to a health facility name and it's borough based on the health facility they were searching for. They user has 4 facility choices to chose from; (Child Health Center, Diagnostic & Treatment Center, Acute Care Hospital, Nursing Home).</p>
            <br>
            <p>A major thing to keep in mind while coding in any language is to keep an eye out for small details. Many times these small details can change the entire outocome of the code. It can easily be the defining feature that determines if you finished your project or not. Various small details like misspelled words, missing or additonal symbols can cause various errors in your code. This was one of the major challenges I cam across when doing this project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the future I would like make the results that the user would be receiving more appealing to the user. For 2 reasons specifically, one being that a better appearence can make the content I have look more reliable and by adding extra detail to the appearance of the result it can help the user be more informed. A few things I would like to add to polish up the appearance is to add images of the buildings of the health facilities and to add a background color for the page as well as have a better organization set up for the facilities. </p>
